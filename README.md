the remove_chars function takes a string as input and uses slicing to create a new string that starts at the second character (index 1) and ends at the second-to-last character (index -1). This excludes the first and last characters of the original string, and returns the new string.

You can also use this approach to remove the first or last character individually, by using a single colon in the slicing syntax. For example, to remove the first character only, you can use s[1:], and to remove the last character only, you can use s[:-1].
